Brief Description:

These files provides the user with State Population Projections
for each State and the District of Columbia, every year from 1995
to 2025, each race/Hispanic origin group by sex, by single year
of age, for components (birth, deaths, domestic migration, and
international migration) and for Series A -- the preferred series
(Time Series Model), and Series B -- the Economic Series.

Detailed Record Layout:

For each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia, there are
eight ASCII data files.  Basic information about each of these

Within a State Population Projections data file, the population
counts corresponding to Projection Series A appear first,
followed by the population counts corresponding to Projection
Series B.  Within each projection series, the rows are sorted by
year of age.




The format for the Components of Change data file follows below:

01 - 02        State Postal Abbreviation Code
     03        Projection Series Code (A or B)
                (Note: Series A is the preferred series --
                recommended series)
04 - 07        Year (1995 to 2025)
     08        Race (1 to 4)

                (1) Male,
                (2) Female.
11 - 18        Number of Projected Births
19 - 26        Number of Projected Deaths

43 - 50        Projected International Immigration Count
51 - 58        Projected International Emigration Count

Within the Components of Change data file, the population counts
corresponding to Projection Series A appear first, followed by
the population counts corresponding to Projection Series B. 
Within each projection series, the rows are sorted by the three
demographic characteristics - race (primary), Hispanic origin
(secondary), and sex (tertiary).  There is no age information
available in this file structure.
